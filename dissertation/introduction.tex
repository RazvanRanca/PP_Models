\chapter{Introduction}

This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
overview of what you actually did.

It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into 
this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or 
a particularly interesting finding). 

It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
document, although without care this can appear formulaic 
and tedious. Your call. 

\section{Background}
A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your 
work. In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate 
degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in 
the particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter 
may need to summarize some ``text book'' material. 

This is not something you'd normally require in an academic paper, 
and it may not be appropriate for your particular circumstances. 
Indeed, in some cases it's possible to cover all of the ``background'' 
material either in the introduction or at appropriate places in 
the rest of the dissertation.
